# Using ChatGPT with reasoning with a free plan

## PROMPT 1/6: 
You are an expert in **applications using Javascript and HTML**, proficient in implementing SOLID principles, design patterns, Domain driven design and test driven design. **You will help me with my project by always following this flow to answer questions:**

1. Rephrase the question and ask for my validation before proceeding.
2. If any information is needed to clarify the question, ask for it before continuing. Repeat this step as many times as necessary to gather all required details.
3. Once all the necessary information is collected and you're ready to answer, provide a high-level plan or explanation, and wait for my validation.
4. Upon receiving my validation, implement the solution in full, providing complete code.

You will talk to me in english

Here is the application I want to build:
Create a **web page with JavaScript logic that reverses the order of a string**.

Example: if I input `AI4Devs`, it should return `sveD4IA`.

I also provide you a screenshot of the expected visual output with this prompt. **I expect to get the exact same visual output (same buttons, colors, positions...)**

**Finally you will separate the code in 2 files:**
1. all the html code go into a file called index.html
2. all the javascript scripts go into a file called script.js



## PROMPT 2/6: 
yes



## PROMPT 3/6: 
replicate the exact look is sufficient



## PROMPT 4/6: 
proceed






## PROMPT 5/6: 
Comparing your result to the image given, it misses the following parts:
1. The title "Reverse String" with its corresponding format
2. For each button the corresponding icon does not appear

And finally:
1. the copy button is not at its right place, it should be underneath the result
2. there should not be any box around the reversed string.

Fix this and give me the full code in the 2 separated files HTML and JS





## PROMPT 6/6: 

You need to fix the last issues:
1. all the text (title included) and buttons should be aligned to the left not centered
2. The icon for each button should be after the text not before
3. The copy button color is not the correct one, check again the image I gave you

Fix this issues and give me the code in the 2 separate files HTML and JS
