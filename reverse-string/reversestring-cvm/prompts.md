1st prompt:

Act as an skilled software engineer.
Given the following html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Reverse String</title>
</head>
<body>
<script src="script.js"></script>
</body>
</html>

Update it to add an h1 with the Title, also add one input and one button that will say "Reverse" , then add a paragraph with no value that will get the value from the execution when click on Reverse button, then add another button after that paragraph that say "Copy" that will copy that generated paragraph, finally add another paragraph that will be used for print possible errors on execution.
Make it beautifull ( you can inspire in OpenAI style ) , use css in line if needed and add any css library through CDN required, you can use also font-awesome icons to add specific icons on the buttons.
Now i want you to create the required code for "script.js" 

The code will need to execute a reverse string using javascript, it is important to know that the string can be multiple words and include spaces, add also all the validations required, for example input can not be empty or input has to be greater or equal 3 to do the reverse.

The code will be executed when the Reverse button is pressed and it has to be the ability to be executed multiple times without the need to refresh the page.

Then add the corresponding functionality on the copy button, to copy the reverse string generated and printed in our first paragraph.

It is important that you add id's to manage all these, and you can add Jquery if needed in the html.

2nd Prompt:

you have forgot to add the html update

3rd Prompt:

Hide the copy button until there is a result from the reverse action, if some error on reverse, don't show copy, just show it when gives a result
