ChatGPT:

I have a basic index.html file that includes a javascript script.
The HTML file has a text input with ID 'input' and a span with id 'output'.
The script file is blank now, but I need you to generate the necessary logic in order to output to the span whatever string is introduced in the input when it has any change in its content, but reversed.
