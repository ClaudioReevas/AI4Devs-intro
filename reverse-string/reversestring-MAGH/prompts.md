As an expert in software development and best practices, I want you to provide me with the code of two files.

A javascript file with the following characteristics:
- That has a function to invert the order of a string passed by parameter.
- It must have a function to copy to the clipboard the outcome of the previous function.
- That it has unit tests to verify the good operation of both functions.
- Relevant comments on the operation of each function
- Comments on how to run the tests, plus a brief explanation of each of the tests. 

html file that complies with the following characteristics:
- That it faithfully reproduces the css design of the attached image.
- That the buttons have the same icons as in the attached image.
- That the reserve button is hidden and appears when the user enters 3 letters.
- That the outcome disappears when the text input is deleted.
