## Prompts used to solve the problem. Using ChatGPT 4o

### Initial version

I turn to you because you're good at web programming.  I need to add some simple interactive functionality to an existing web page:
* a form field that allows me to enter a text, followed by a button with the text "Reverse!".
* When I click the button I want the web page to display the text in from the form field just below the field, but reversed, so that "asdf" becomes "fdsa", etc.
The existing web page reads JS from `script.js`, so please respond with two snippets, one that I can paste into the existing html file and one for the js file.

### For the "dynamic" version

I turn to you because you're good at web programming.  I need to add some simple interactive functionality to an existing web page:
* a form field, labelled "Input", that allows me to enter a text
* The row below should display "Reversed:" followed by the result of reversing the text in form field (eg, an input of "asdf" gives an output of "fdsa").  The output should update as I type, so I don't need a button or anything except the labels and the field.
