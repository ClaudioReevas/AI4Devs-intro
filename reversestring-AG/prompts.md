# Prompts used

## Prompt 1:

Create a webpage that accepts a string as input and reverses the string when the user presses the "Reverse" button, but only if the user has typed more than 3 characters.

- The "Reverse" button should be visible only if the user has typed at least 3 characters.
- Show the reversed string below the input field in a div called "output."
- Use index.html and script.js files to implement this logic, and styles.css for the layout.

Thank you for your help!

## Prompt 2:

Good, let's proceed with the next step:

- add another feature to reverse the string in real-time
- be sure to don't touch the previous logic

## Prompt 3:

Can we clean the code? , i would like to incapsulate the logic in dedicated a function
and use a global var for the numbers of chars?

## Prompt 4:
